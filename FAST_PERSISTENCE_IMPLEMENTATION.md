# Fast Persistence Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Previously, the fasting tracker stored active fast state only in the browser (localStorage), which meant:
- Fasts did not persist across different devices
- Users logging in from a different browser/device would not see their active fast
- Fast state was lost if browser storage was cleared

## Solution Implemented
Implemented server-side fast state management using the existing `ActiveFast` MongoDB model and API endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server (Already Existed - Verified)
The server already had the necessary endpoints in `server/server.js`:

- **GET /api/active-fast** (protected) - Retrieves the user's active fast from MongoDB
- **POST /api/active-fast** (protected) - Creates or updates the user's active fast
- **DELETE /api/active-fast** (protected) - Removes the user's active fast

The `ActiveFast` model (`server/models/ActiveFast.js`) stores:
- userId (reference to User)
- startTime
- fastType ('wet' or 'dry')
- notes array
- updatedAt timestamp

### 2. Client Store Updates (`client/src/store/useActiveFastStore.ts`)

**Added `isLoading` state** to track loading status

**Added `loadActiveFast()` method:**
- Called on app initialization when user is authenticated
- Fetches active fast from server via GET /api/active-fast
- Handles 404 (no active fast) gracefully
- Populates store with server state

**Updated `startFast()` method:**
- Now calls POST /api/active-fast to persist to server
- Updates local state after successful server save

**Updated `stopFast()` method:**
- Saves completed fast to history (POST /api/save-fast)
- Deletes active fast from server (calls resetFast)
- Returns success/failure status

**Updated `addNote()` method:**
- Adds note to local state
- Syncs entire active fast (including new note) to server

**Updated `deleteNote()` method:**
- Removes note from local state
- Syncs updated notes array to server

**Updated `resetFast()` method:**
- Now async - calls DELETE /api/active-fast
- Clears local state after server deletion

### 3. App Component Updates (`client/src/App.tsx`)

**Added useEffect hook:**
- Runs when user becomes authenticated
- Calls `loadActiveFast()` to restore active fast from server
- Ensures fast state is loaded fresh on every login/page refresh

## How It Works Now

### Starting a Fast
1. User clicks "Start Fast"
2. Client calls `startFast()` which POSTs to /api/active-fast
3. Server creates/updates ActiveFast document in MongoDB
4. Local state updates to show timer running

### Switching Devices
1. User logs in on Device B
2. App.tsx useEffect triggers on authentication
3. `loadActiveFast()` fetches active fast from server
4. Timer resumes with correct start time and notes

### Adding Notes
1. User adds a note during fast
2. Client calls `addNote()` which POSTs updated notes to /api/active-fast
3. Server updates the ActiveFast document
4. Note persists across devices

### Stopping a Fast
1. User clicks "Stop Fast"
2. Client calls `stopFast()` which:
   - POSTs to /api/save-fast (saves to history)
   - DELETEs from /api/active-fast (removes active state)
3. Fast appears in history, active state cleared

## Benefits
✅ Fast state persists across devices
✅ Users can switch browsers/devices mid-fast
✅ Notes sync in real-time
✅ Server is source of truth
✅ Automatic cleanup of stale fasts (already implemented in server)

## API Authentication
All endpoints use the `requireAuth` middleware which:
- Validates JWT token from Authorization header
- Attaches userId to request
- Ensures users can only access their own fasts

## Production Build
Client rebuilt successfully with new persistence logic:
- Output: `client/dist`
- Build time: ~14s
- No TypeScript errors
- Ready for Docker deployment
