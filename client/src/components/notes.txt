Removing .env from tracking prevents future pushes from including it, but any secrets that were previously committed and pushed remain in the remote history.

MongoDB connection string (change the user's password and update the connection URI)
JWT secret (generate a new, strong random secret)
Email password

Rotating those credentials.
Rewriting git history to remove the secrets from all commits (using BFG or git-filter-repo) â€” note that rewriting history requires force-push and coordination with anyone else using the repo.
