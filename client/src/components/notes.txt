Persisting the active fast server-side means a user's timer can be rehydrated on another device/browser after login. If you want cross-device live syncing (e.g., real-time second-by-second), you'd need WebSockets or polling.


Important security note (action required)

Removing .env from tracking prevents future pushes from including it, but any secrets that were previously committed and pushed remain in the remote history.
You should rotate the exposed secrets immediately:
MongoDB connection string (change the user's password and update the connection URI)
JWT secret (generate a new, strong random secret)
Email password
If you want, I can guide you through:
Rotating those credentials.
Rewriting git history to remove the secrets from all commits (using BFG or git-filter-repo) — note that rewriting history requires force-push and coordination with anyone else using the repo.

 minnor reformat of email??

total trophy count (based on fast history)

==================================

How you can run / verify locally

Run server tests (runs both tests):
Open PowerShell in server folder and run:
You should see both tests pass (model + endpoints).
Use the dev script to list schedules:
Basic:
Filter by user:
Filter by startTime:
Limit:
Enable debug logs temporarily
Start server with debug logs:
Or set in .env: DEBUG_LOGS=true

Virtualize the list of history entries

What: Use a virtualization library (react-window, react-virtual, or TanStack Virtual) to only render the visible slice of the history list.
Benefit: Very large lists render and scroll smoothly; big wins for thousands of rows.
Cost: Slightly more code complexity (item sizing/height management); awkward if expanded items have variable heights (requires VariableSizeList or dynamic measurement).
Effort: ~45–90 minutes (depends on whether items are fixed-height).
Acceptance check: smooth scrolling for large history; only items in view are mounted.
Virtualize large note lists inside details

What: If a single fast can have many notes, virtualize the notes list inside AccordionDetails.
Benefit: Avoids mounting thousands of note DOM nodes.
Cost: Same as above, plus nested virtualization complexity.
Effort: ~30–60 minutes.
Heavier / advanced (1–2 days)
Switch to controlled expansion + fetch-on-expand or on-demand rendering

What: Keep only lightweight summaries in DOM, and when the user expands, fetch/render the details (or render offloaded content in a portal or modal).
Benefit: Minimal initial DOM, best UX when details are heavy or include charts/media.
Cost: UX change (slightly different flow), more network logic if fetching.
Effort: 2–8+ hours depending on fetching and caching.
Offload heavy rendering (web worker / offscreen canvas)

What: If details include heavy CPU work (charts, formatting), offload to web worker or pre-render elsewhere.
Benefit: smoother UI thread.
Cost: Most complex; rarely necessary for plain lists.
Effort: days.
